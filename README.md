A Wesnoth add-on campaign, copied from the BfW 1.12 add-on server to forward-port to 1.14, and then to 1.16.

515YW, you are the young dwarven leader Hamel.
Your tribe in the Knalga caverns near Dwarven Doors gets under pressure from its enemies, while resources are getting rare at the same time.
Guide your people on your quest for more and better minerals, to be able to forge new armor and weapons and resist your opponents.
